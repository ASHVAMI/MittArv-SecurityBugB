MittArv Security Bug Bounty - Testing Project
Welcome to the MittArv security bug bounty testing project! This repository contains the necessary code and instructions to test the MittArv Android app for potential security vulnerabilities. This project includes scripts to automate basic security tests and take screenshots during the testing process.

1. Project Setup
1.1. Prerequisites
Before running the tests, ensure that the following software is installed on your system:

Node.js (v14.x or higher)
npm (Node Package Manager)
Chrome (latest version)
Android Emulator (for testing the Android app)
1.2. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mittarv-bug-bounty.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd mittarv-bug-bounty
1.3. Install Dependencies
The project uses npm to manage dependencies. Run the following command to install all the necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
npm install
2. Configuration
Open the configuration file config/environment.js and update it with the appropriate app URL and referral code (provided in the assignment).

javascript
Copy code
module.exports = {
  appUrl: 'https://mittarv-android-app-url.com',
  referralCode: '2402ASMT',
  emulatorDetails: 'Android Emulator API 29',
};
3. Running the Security Tests
The testing scripts are automated to check for basic security vulnerabilities, such as SQL Injection and unencrypted sensitive data. The script also takes screenshots to aid in documentation.

3.1. Running Chrome Screenshot Test
To capture a screenshot of the MittArv app's web interface using Chrome, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
node src/testing/security-tests.js
This will:

Launch the Chrome browser.
Navigate to the app's web interface.
Perform security tests (e.g., SQL Injection) and log the results.
Take a screenshot and save it to the /reports/ folder.
3.2. Running Emulator Screenshot Test
Ensure your Android emulator is running, then take a screenshot by running:

bash
Copy code
adb exec-out screencap -p > ./reports/emulator-screenshot.png
4. Testing Results
After running the tests, you'll find the following files:

Vulnerabilities Log: The security vulnerabilities identified are logged in logs/vulnerabilities.log.
Screenshots: The captured screenshots are saved in the /reports/ folder, with filenames like chrome-screenshot.png and emulator-screenshot.png.
Testing Report: A detailed report of the security testing, including steps, vulnerabilities, and reproduction instructions, is found in reports/testing-report.md.
5. Coding Practices
Ensure that consistent coding practices are followed throughout the project.
Add comments to explain code where necessary.
Code must be factored in a way that optimizes performance and maintenance.
6. Submitting the Project
GitHub Submission: Once you've completed the testing and all required documents are generated, push the code to your personal GitHub repository.

Make sure there are no build exceptions before pushing the code.
All project files must be committed from your personal GitHub account.
Final Report: Create a vulnerabilities-report.pdf with all the vulnerabilities found and testing details (including screenshots). This document is to be submitted along with the code.

7. Additional Information
The project automates a basic security testing process and logs vulnerabilities.
This project can be extended with additional tests, like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), CSRF, etc.
Use the referral code 2402ASMT when testing the Android app.
By following the steps in this README.md, you should be able to successfully run the tests, capture screenshots, and report any vulnerabilities found in the MittArv Android app.

Good luck with your testing!
